ITEM.description = "A green gaseous artifact."
ITEM.longdesc = "A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artifact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize radioactive particles inside the body. It is highly effective, making it incredibly valuable to stalkers. Inhaling the gases emitted by this artifact is widely known to cause stomach gas buildup, leading to belching, flatulence, or pressure-related discomfort.\n\nThe Ecologists warn that frequent use of the Bubble can disrupt the gut biome and alter internal structures. While studies are scarce due to the Bubble's rarity, it is generally agreed that long-term users may eventually be restricted to consuming food produced within the Zone. This includes radioactive or mutated meat, as well as the rare organic anomalies and artifacts. Nonetheless, the Ecologists also advise against consuming such items, as it remains unclear whether the Bubble provides any protection from their harmful effects."
