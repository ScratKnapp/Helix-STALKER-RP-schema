ITEM.longdesc = "This legendary artifact sometimes goes undiscovered for years. It is able to find gaps in even the most complex anomaly fields, allowing the user to traverse them with ease. Proper use of the artifact requires knowledge on how to handle it. Legend says the artifact holds a deeper power to those that can unlock it.\n\nScientists claim the Compass has never made its way to their hands, and traders who have claimed to have purchased one never hear if it makes it to the buyer. Some say the Compass is bound to the Zone, and teleports itself back into the far reaches as soon as it passes the edge. Some of the oldest stalkers say that the Compass appears when one most needs it; and when they need to use it the most, it will guide them to safety. Afterwards, it disappears to the Zone once more."
