ITEM.longdesc = "A legendary artifact known only to a small handful of Stalkers, the Mica is the ultimate evolution of the Slime line of artifacts, and by far the most potent, even if the weaknesses put the user in harms way.\n\nSome artifacts are believed to be organisms, growing as they are used and becoming something more, perhaps even anomalies themselves. While the Slug may be a parasite feeding off of Stalkers, the Mica is likely a predator. Those that use it find it difficult to pry away, and in some cases respond with violence at the thought of it being taken or sold. Perhaps the rarity of the Mica is not because it is rarely formed, but because those that find it, human or mutant, refuse to let it go."
