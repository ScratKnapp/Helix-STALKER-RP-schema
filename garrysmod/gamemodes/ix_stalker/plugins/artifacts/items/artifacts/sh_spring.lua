ITEM.longdesc = "Believed to be the rare hybrid of a Battery and a Shell, the Spring is one of the legendary artifacts in the Zone. Increasing Impact resistance by an absurd amount and with no downsides, the Spring is sought after by many in and out of the Zone, though many buyers have a higher use in mind for it than merely protecting a person.\n\nThe Spring is composed of two disks held together by an almost invisible force, one which cannot be swayed. Nothing, at least in the Zone, has been capable of separating the disks or moving them closer. Few stalkers have ever seen a Spring, and so side effects of the artifact are totally unknown, if they even exist."
